            *This is the Social Security Tax to be deposited in a separate revenue account (11211) provided for this
            purpose. However, tax payers registered as sole proprietorship or on pension income or on income from
            contribution based pension funds shall not attract social security tax i.e. 1%. And if the taxpayer is
            depositing an amount in the Social Security Fund (SSF) then for those taxpayers Social Security Tax is not
            applicable. <br> <br>** 36 % is computed as 30% plus additional 20% on such tax rate applicable to taxable
            income above Rs 2,000,000. <br><br> To calculate your tax liability add all the personal incomes and check
            for the slabs to find out rates. For example if you are unmarried and you earn Nrs 5,50,000 per year, your
            tax is calculated as: <br> br
            4,00,000*1%=Rs 4000 Plus <br><br>

            1,00,000*10%= Rs. 10000 Plus <br><br>

            50,000*20%= Rs 10000 <br><br>
